\title{dragulaSelectR: Utilizes Dragula JS library to implement a drag-and-drop Shiny select input.}
\description{
Utilizes Dragula JS library to implement a drag-and-drop Shiny select input.
Dragula is a drag-and-drop javascript library that is very lightweight and robust.
This implementation creates a Shiny input that replicates much of the functionality of
selectInput. Multiple zones for dragging and dropping are allowed. See the Dragula JS
library for more information (https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula).
