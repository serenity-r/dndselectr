Description: Utilizes Dragula JS library to implement a drag-and-drop Shiny select input. 
    Dragula is a drag-and-drop javascript library that is very lightweight and robust.
    This implementation creates a Shiny input that replicates much of the functionality of 
    selectInput. Multiple zones for dragging and dropping are allowed. See the Dragula JS
    library for more information (https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula).
